<p>
  Hi there! My name is Jake Keuhlen. This blog started as my place to write down some engineering thoughts, design patterns, and tutorials, but who knows what it's become now that you're reading this. I plan to write more about whatever topics are interesting to me at the time. At the least, I'll still sprinkle in technical topics from my engineering work.
  <br>
  Currently, I'm a Principal Engineer at <a href="https://mercury.com">Mercury</a>. I also publish novels at <a href="https://infernalmoose.com">Infernal Moose Publishing</a> and write software to make publishers more productive at <a href="https://familiar.pub">Familiar</a>.
  <br>
  Outside of my day job, I'm an avid climber, outdoorsman, gamer, gardener, husband, father, and I also coach a high school speech and debate team!
  <br>
  <br>
  Is there a topic you want to learn more about? I'd love to help teach you. <a href="/contact">Reach out and let me know.</a>
</p>
