<p>
  Hi there! My name is Jake Keuhlen. I've been working in software since 2013, and stumbled into a job working in Haskell in 2016. Since then, I've grown to love the language and want to share my experience with others. This blog is my place to write down my thoughts, share design patterns, write tutorials, etc. 
  <br>
  Outside of programming I'm an avid climber, outdoorsman, board game enthusiast, gamer, and husband.

  Is there a topic you want to learn more about? I'd love to help teach you. <a href="/contact">Reach out and let me know.</a>
